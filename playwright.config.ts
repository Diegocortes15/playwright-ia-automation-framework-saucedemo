// Clean-room config (e2e-jira-from-issues), data-driven from tests/users.ts
// (Phase H / ADR-0014). Projects derive from AUTH_USERS, which /from-issue grows
// one user at a time as tickets require authenticated pages. @sort-functional is dormant:
// nothing greps it, so it routes to no project — see docs/architecture.md before reviving it.

// Cross-browser is present but OPT-IN (ADR-0027, superseding ADR-0004). Firefox and WebKit
// projects only enter the list when asked for, so `npm test` stays chromium and stays fast;
// choosing when to pay for another engine is a project's call, not the framework's.
//
// Asked for = the CROSS_BROWSER env var, and ONLY that. An earlier version also sniffed
// `process.argv` for a --project naming an engine, so the bare command would work without the
// flag. It does not: Playwright re-evaluates this config inside every worker process, and a
// worker's argv does not carry the parent's --project. The projects therefore existed in the
// main process, listed correctly, started running, and then every test died with
// `Project "firefox-no-auth" not found in the worker process`. An env var propagates to
// workers; argv does not. Use the npm scripts, which set it for you.
//
// Only the standard user goes cross-browser, per the guardrail ADR-0004 established and this
// record keeps: engine differences live in OUR interaction code, not in saucedemo's per-user
// bugs, so re-running problem_user on three engines buys nothing. Both of its contexts are
// mirrored, though — a smoke run on Firefox that omitted `@no-auth` would omit logging in,
// which is the single most valuable thing to check on another engine.
