# Failure modes

Where this framework breaks, what catches it, and what still does not.

**The rule for this page:** every claim is verified against the code, or it says it is unmeasured. Nothing here is an estimate dressed as a fact. Where a failure mode has no mitigation, it is listed anyway — a page that only lists solved problems is marketing.

## The four questions

### "How does this scale to a real application?"

The mechanics travel. The base URL, credentials and TCMS settings are env-driven through a single read point (`src/utils/env.ts`); the project matrix derives from one array and grows on demand ([ADR-0014](adr/0014-from-issue-harness-growth.md)); Page Objects are per-app and the composition rules are enforced by lint, not convention.

**What has never been exercised, and it is a lot:**

- **An application that changes.** saucedemo is frozen. Selector drift — the single most common cause of suite rot — has never happened here once. Every claim about locator stability in this repo is therefore theoretical.
- **Test data.** saucedemo needs no setup, no teardown, no isolation between parallel workers. A real app usually needs all three, and none of that machinery exists.
- **Authentication beyond a login form.** No MFA, no token refresh, no session expiry mid-run. `storageState` is generated once per user and reused.
- **Scale.** 8 features, 83 tests, 6 products. Nothing here has met a suite where run time or sharding is the constraint.

The honest summary: the _authoring_ layer is the transferable part. The runtime is a small, well-behaved suite against a small, well-behaved app.

### "What happens when the LLM hallucinates a selector or an acceptance criterion?"

This is the best-defended area, because it is the one that was designed for.

- **A run never opens a red pull request** ([ADR-0020](adr/0020-no-red-pr.md)). A hallucinated selector fails locally; the run diagnoses, retries up to three times, and if it still fails it reports and opens nothing.
- **Selectors are verified against the live DOM** before being written, via `playwright-cli` — not inferred from the page's source or from memory.
- **A downgrade is reported, not hidden.** Skills must render an `Obstacles encountered` section even when empty ([ADR-0022](adr/0022-obstacles-encountered.md)), and a selector written below the best available level has to be named there.
- **When the app contradicts the ticket, the run stops.** Real case: **SW-13** asked that `problem_user` be able to sort products. The tests were right and the app was wrong, so no PR was opened at all. The tests landed later, as `test.fail()` locked to the defect SW-14, only after a person decided ([ADR-0024](adr/0024-blocked-test-lands-as-expected-failure.md)).

**The gap:** all of that catches a _wrong_ selector. None of it catches a **plausible but incomplete** test — one that passes, asserts something true, and misses the point of the criterion. The PR body carries the agent's reasoning and its assumptions precisely so a human can catch that, and a human is the only thing that does.

### "What does a ticket cost in tokens?"

**Unmeasured.** No number is recorded anywhere in this repo, and inventing one would be worse than admitting it.

What would measure it: `/skill-doctor` reports observed per-skill context cost, and it is a Claude Code UI command, so a person has to run it. Until someone does, this question has no answer here.

### "What if Qase goes down, or the team switches TCMS?"

An outage is genuinely harmless. The mirror is **opt-in and self-skipping** — with `QASE_API_TOKEN` unset both entry points print `TCMS off … skipping` and exit cleanly — and the sync runs **at merge**, not at PR time ([ADR-0017](adr/0017-tcms-sync-at-merge.md)), so Qase being down cannot block a pull request or a test run.

**Switching vendors is a smaller job than a rewrite and a bigger one than this repo's README used to claim.** That README said `src/tcms/qase-client.ts` is "the only Qase-aware file". Measured on 2026-09-08, **eleven** files mention Qase:

| File                                 | Mentions | What that means                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tcms/qase-client.ts`                | 7        | **The real seam.** Every HTTP call to Qase lives here and nowhere else. |
| `tcms/run-report.ts`                 | 20       | Orchestration — and it does `new QaseClient(cfg)` directly (line 144)   |
| `tcms/suite-sync.ts`                 | 13       | Same, at line 115                                                       |
| `tcms/map-store.ts`, `tcms/types.ts` | 8, 5     | The `QaseMap` type and `qase-map.json`                                  |
| `utils/qase-env.ts`                  | 6        | Reads the `QASE_*` variables                                            |
| 5 more files                         | 1–3 each | Incidental — a comment, a type name                                     |

So: the HTTP surface really is one file, which is the part that matters. But the **vocabulary leaks** — the client is constructed at two call sites rather than injected, and a type named `QaseMap` would end up holding Xray ids. A swap means editing those two constructions and either renaming across ten files or living with vendor names on generic things.

## What has actually broken here

The credible half of this page. Each of these happened, was found, and has something that catches the next one.

| **A decision recorded and never implemented.** ADR-0004 said "add `firefox-standard` and `webkit-standard`"; five projects existed and no Firefox or WebKit. Meanwhile `CLAUDE.md`, the roadmap and ADR-0014 all cited it as the reason cross-browser stayed _out_ — the opposite of what it decided | 4 months, `Accepted`                         | Every ADR declares **`Enforced by:`**, and `npm run lint:adr` fails the build when configuration contradicts one                                 |
| **A skill's reference table drifting from the code it describes.** `BurgerMenu.ts` landed 2026-06-03 and no row was added, so `/scaffold-page-object` **aborted on every invocation, against any URL**. The reference file was even edited in that window and the gap still went unseen              | 3 months                                     | `check-component-signatures.sh` reconciles both directions and exits non-zero ([ADR-0025](adr/0025-component-signatures-reconcile-both-ways.md)) |
| **A documented command that could not run.** The skill workflow said `playwright-cli open`; the binary is in `node_modules/.bin`, not on `PATH`                                                                                                                                                      | Unknown — nothing executes documentation     | `npm run lint:docs` fails on any bash block invoking a binary that only exists in `node_modules/.bin`                                            |
| **A green run whose record said the opposite.** A flaky test is `success` to the job, and the reader took the _first_ attempt — the failed one — so Qase recorded `failed` for a test that had passed                                                                                                | Never fired in 200 CI runs; found by reading | The last attempt decides the status, and the retry is named in the case comment                                                                  |

| **A race one browser was fast enough to hide.** `InventoryPage.goto()` returned before the product list rendered; ten tests read a list on the next line. Chromium always won that race; WebKit lost it one run in five                                                                              | Since the Page Object existed                | The wait lives in the Page Object.

| **A pull request merged into an already-merged branch.** SW-12's work never reached `main`                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Minutes                                      | `sync-base-branch.sh` refuses to run on a previous ticket's branch or a stale base                                                               |

The pattern worth naming: **six of the seven are documentation or records drifting from reality, not code defects.** That is what this framework's gates are mostly for.

## What has no mitigation

- **Token cost is unmeasured.** See above.
- **The framework has never faced an application that changes.** Every claim about selector durability is untested.
- **No test-data isolation exists**, because saucedemo needs none.
- **Six of the seven Page Objects share a pattern proven fragile.** `goto()` navigates and returns without waiting for anything. Only `InventoryPage` was fixed, because only it has failed — and the other six have never run outside chromium, the engine that hid the problem. The mitigation is detection rather than prevention: Playwright marks a flake natively, the scheduled run's Slack message prints the count, and the HTML report filters them with a chip. If one of the six flakes, it announces itself.
- **A plausible-but-wrong test passes every gate.** Nothing but a human reviewer stands between a test that asserts something true and a test that covers the criterion.
- **One author.** Whether these conventions survive contact with a second person is untested, and the skill-portability check is a manual `grep` by deliberate choice ([ADR-0019](adr/0019-skill-portability.md)) — at this scale a CI gate was judged compliance theater.
