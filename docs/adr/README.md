# Architecture Decision Records

[Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). Start from `0000-template.md`.

This practice was checked against the documented standard on **2026-09-07**, after the immutability rule started to feel like a maintenance tax. The conclusion was that the rule is right and the way we were using the records was wrong. Sources at the bottom.

## The two layers — read this before anything else

**ADRs are a decision log, not the design guide.** [Azure Well-Architected][waf] is explicit: _"Avoid making decision records design guides. If more justification or design ideation is available, provide a link to a document as supplemental material."_

That distinction is the whole fix. If answering _"how does JSON load today?"_ requires reading ADR-0005 **and** ADR-0023, you are reading an audit log to learn the present — and it will feel like a tax, because it is one.

| Layer       | Where                                            | Mutable?                                               | Answers                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Present** | `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/app/`, `CLAUDE.md` | **Yes** — correct in place, noting what it said before | _What is true now?_           |
| **Log**     | `docs/adr/`                                      | **No** — append only                                   | _Why did it become this way?_ |

[arc42][arc42] structures documentation the same way: the decisions that shape the system live in §4 Solution Strategy (current state), and §9 expands them with context. It explicitly warns against duplicating between the two.

**A record may cite the present layer. The present layer may cite a record for the "why". Neither replaces the other.**

## Never edit an accepted ADR

Confirmed as the standard, not a local quirk. [Azure Well-Architected][waf]: _"The ADR serves as an append-only log. Don't go back and edit accepted records. If a decision changes, write a new record that supersedes the original and link the two together. This approach preserves the history of your thinking and makes it clear when and why the direction shifted."_

Reversing a decision means a new record that supersedes it; narrowing one means a record that scopes it.

> A minority position exists — [some argue][reflect] that in practice mutability works better, inserting dated notes into the original record. It is recorded here so the choice is visible rather than assumed. This repo follows the append-only majority: Nygard, arc42 and Microsoft agree, and the history of a reversed decision is the part worth keeping.

## Does this decision belong here?

The admission bar is [Azure Well-Architected's][waf], adopted verbatim because it is tighter than "an architectural decision changed":

> _Only include choices that affect the system's **structure**, **key quality attributes**, or are **difficult to reverse**._

A `no` to all three means it is not an ADR — write it in the reference or doc it governs instead. `0000-template.md` carries the three questions and a worked negative.

## Every record declares four things

| Field           | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**      | _"Tracking status makes the current state of each decision clear, especially as the number of decisions grows"_ ([WAF][waf]). ADR-0005 sat `Accepted` for three and a half months while false — the mechanism existed, nobody moved it |
| **Confidence**  | _"Record the confidence level… Sometimes an architecturally significant decision is made with relatively low confidence"_ ([WAF][waf]). Say what would change your mind                                                                |
| **Review by**   | A date only when the decision has a shelf life — deferred scope, a vendor, a scale assumption. A prompt to re-read, not an expiry                                                                                                      |
| **Enforced by** | The lint rule, test, config or script that makes it true, or `Nothing — prose only`. If a decision states something a machine can check, write the check — ADR-0023 exists because one didn't                                          |

Records written before 2026-09-07 predate `Confidence` and `Review by`. **They are not being backfilled**: editing them to add fields would break the append-only rule for cosmetics, and a confidence level invented months after the fact is fiction.

## The budget, and how to count against it

`docs/roadmap-post-oct-2026.md` principle #4 says a mature framework has **10–20 ADRs in its whole life**. That number is a **local convention with no cited source** — not Nygard, not arc42, not Microsoft, none of which prescribe a count. Taken literally it also contradicts the same principle's "never edit, always supersede" rule, which manufactures records mechanically.

**So count only originating decisions against it.** Records the supersede rule demanded are not discretionary and do not compete for the budget.

|                                   | Count  |
| --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Total records                     | **28** |
| Superseding / scoping / extending | 10     |
| **Originating decisions**         | **18** |

Eighteen is inside the range; twenty-seven is not. Keep the table current when you add one — the point of writing the number down is that the next person sees it before adding the twenty-eighth, which is exactly what nobody could do before this file existed. ADR-0027 was the twenty-seventh and ADR-0028 the twenty-eighth; both moved the superseding count rather than the originating one. 0027 replaced a record that had been `Accepted` and false for four months, and 0028 records that ADR-0013's `allowed-tools` guard does not reach a shell script.
